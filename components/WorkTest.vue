          <span class="text-accent-focus">"Dedicated</span> is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Harrison. I’ve had the pleasure of working with Harrison over the past few months to rebuild a brand post Covid-19 shutdown. Above all, I was impressed with Harrison’s ability to turn limited resources into effective and engaging social media marketing content that heavily impacted metrics. Harrison would be a true asset for any position requiring expert social media marketing skills and efficient communication and I highly recommend him!"
